# 4. Reading Guide: How to find what might interest you

"Physics with XO" intents to be a very wide project that everyone can traverse in their own way.

1. If your interest is the answer to the question "what can I do with an XO that applies to physics?" visit the Youtube video series (in average one minute) that can be found at:

2. If you are interested in developing Experimental Activities that don't imply a risk for the XO (from errors connecting, etc.) you may go directly to **chapter 14 Experimental Activities** and look for those that are identified with codes SR, SI or X in the top right cell of each *Experimental Activity* table (those identified with the SV code involve deeper knowledge).
All programming can be downloaded from:

3. If you wish to study a topic with a more depth than we have been able to provide, you may begin reading the work in linear order, taking into account that **Chapter 9 Accuracy and precision of Analog to Digital conversion** is the most technical in the set. You can refer to its conclusions in a first reading.

4. If you don't have an XO, you may read **Chapter 14 Experimental Activities** in order to learn how to apply what is described in **Annex 4: "Physics with XO" without XO**.
