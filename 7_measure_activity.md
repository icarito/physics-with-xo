# Measure Activity (versions 31, 36 and 42)

The SUGAR graphical user interface includes a very potent tool for working in Experimental Physics and Musical Accoustics: The Measure Activity (Sugar Labs Measure); with it the XO is transformed into a single (XO1) or double (XO1.5 and XO1.75) stroke **oscilloscope** that enables us to analyze the sounds that the XO registers from its built-in microphone, or the voltage or resistance values that can be read thru the external microphone input. Sound registered by the microphone may be analyzed as graphics that display the signal as a function of time (known as *oscilograms*), or as amplitude vs. frequency graphs (**A=f (f)**).

The Measure Activity can also read values of Voltage and Resistance thru an audio cable connected to its external microphone socket. These values are displayed as detailed below in the description of the toolbar for version 31 (displays the voltage and resistance as an integer number to be calibrated), version 36 (displays measures of voltage and resistance already calibrated as Volt or Ohm values, and includes the ability to connect a second sensor) and version 42 (includes on-screen reference lines for fundamental frequencies and their harmonnics for tuning diverse musical instruments).

## Measure Activity version 31: Toolbar

In the area of the screen (divided in a grid by 22 horizontally and 14 vertically), an oscillogram is displayed Voltage=f(time) (Mode SOUND, baseline frequency), or an FFT Amplitude graph = f (frequency) (Mode SOUND, baseline frequency), or rather the value read by the Resistence or Voltage sensor (according to the selection). In the bottom bar, the integer product of the AD conversion is indicated, as shown in the example:
