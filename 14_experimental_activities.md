# 14. Experimental Activities

## Introduction

The hardware of the XO was designed with the possibility of connecting low cost and easy to build sensors to it, making it an ideal instrument for **introducing** our students into data acquisition, treatment and storage of measurements that arise from the interaction of between the XO and the physical world, allowing us to measure a great 
variety of physical magnitudes. We can process the information of the sensors with the "Measure" Activity or else writing programs with the "TurtleBlocks" Activity, which includes tools exclusively for processing sensor readings.

For this, elementary knowledge of programming, electronics and Physics are needed. To integrated and in order for every student make these activities for every student, we have settled on a set of basic criteria that must be met to include a given activity as part of the **"Physics with XO" project**:

    1. The experimental activities must be able to be carried out with any XO model starting from XO1 (the most basic of them).

    2. Planned measurements must be obtained by using the microphone sensors, the built-in camera, or else by mounting sensors. For this we'll use basic electronics, selecting components with two terminals to be connected or (as maximum) three terminals (power 5V DC USB + signal), that can be found locally on stock and which prices is below $U 200 (about 8â‚¬ or U$S 10).

    3. Readings of these sensors should be done with Sugar Activities, or else Linux software included in the images (for example, Audacity).

    4. Programming must be integrated with a perspective of an introduction to programing.

All of this means the Project is fundamentally an introduction of physical measurements with a DA interface; it does not substitute equipment manufactured for that purpose.
