# 14. Experimental Activities

## Introduction

The hardware of the XO was designed with the possibility of connecting low cost and easy to build sensors to it, making it an ideal instrument for **introducing** our students into data acquisition, treatment and storage of measurements that arise from the interaction of between the XO and the physical world, allowing us to measure a great 
variety of physical magnitudes. We can process the information of the sensors with the "Measure" Activity or else writing programs with the "TurtleBlocks" Activity, which includes tools exclusively for processing sensor readings.

For this, elementary knowledge of programming, electronics and Physics are needed. To integrated and in order for every student make these activities for every student, we have settled on a set of basic criteria that must be met to include a given activity as part of the **"Physics with XO" project**:

1. The experimental activities must be able to be carried out with any XO model starting from XO1 (the most basic of them).

2. Planned measurements must be obtained by using the microphone sensors, the built-in camera, or else by mounting sensors. For this we'll use basic electronics, selecting components with two terminals to be connected or (as maximum) three terminals (power 5V DC USB + signal), that can be found locally on stock and which prices is below $U 200 (about 8â‚¬ or U$S 10).

3. Readings of these sensors should be done with Sugar Activities, or else Linux software included in the images (for example, Audacity).

4. Programming must be integrated with a perspective of an introduction to programing.

Because of this, the Project must be considered and introduction of physical measurements with a DA interface; under no circumstances is it meant to substitute equipment manufactured for that purpose.

## Experimental Activities

Following we include a series of ideas to develop Experimental Activities with XO: among them we may find the some using constructed sensors that must be programmed, measurements coming from the built-in sensors or those that make use of built-in elements of the XO such as the lid-close magnet or the charger; there are qualitative as well as quantitative ones; some integrate games (Primary school), elements for discovery of physical phenomena (Primary and basic Secondary) as well as experiments for the level of higher Secondary school. It is the author's intention to make a contribution for those that want to integrate Physics in their courses, Workshops, or to discover it by personal exploration, and so these ideas are presented with the understanding that what's most important is not what has been done but what readers will want to do based on it.

### <u>IMPORTANT NOTE:</u>

1. If you are interested in developing Experimental Activities that pose no risk to your XO (from wrong connections, etc.) you may look in this chapter for *Experimental Activity* sheets that are identified in the upper right cell of each table with the codes:

    1. <font color='green'>SR (resistive sensor)</font>
    2. SI (integrated sensor)
    3. X (no sensor) or
    4. Mic. Ext. (external microphone)

      For a higher level one may work (taking into precautions into account) with the ones identified with the codes:

    5. <font color='red'>SV (voltage sensor)</font>
    6. <font color='green'>SR</font> <font color='red'>USB</font>

## A) VOLTAGE <br><u>AC Voltage</u>

### Introduction

The external microphone input of the XO allows the reading of very small AC values, in the order of **some mili volts**. In the case of periodic signals, these values may be captured with the Measure Activity; with it you will be able to:

1. Capture the waveform produced from reading a given signal working with *Time Base*. Identify (qualitatively) the type of signal by observing the waveform: sinusoidal signal, square, triangular, "beat" (sum of oscillations of similar frequencies), etc. Determine the period of the measured signal and calculate the frequency of it.

2. Measure the frequencies of the different components working with *Frequency Base*.

### Measuring range

**XO1:** According to measurements made, it's possible to measure sinusoidal signals of effective voltage of 4.0 mV, which corresponds with a maximum voltage of 5.6 mV and a $$V _ {\text{pp}}$$ ("peak to peak" voltage) in the order of **13 mV**. Accordingly, only very small signals will be measurable, or voltage dividers will be needed to measure higher voltage signals.

### Sampling frequency

According to its technical specifications, the sampling frequency of the XO for the Measure Activity is above 48 kHz, which would allow to determine (from Nyquist's sampling theorem) the signal frequency of components with maximum frequencies of about 20 kHz.

This type of signal an also be captured with TB programs and the `sound` sensor block. However, the reading frequency in this case won't reach more than some 20 Hz (XO1) which makes it impractical for this use.
